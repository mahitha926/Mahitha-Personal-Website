    <h2>About:</h2> 

I’m currently a freshman at the University of Maryland pursuing a major in Computer Science, with a strong interest in exploring AI/ML and quantum computing pathways. To strengthen my technical skills, I’m an active member of the AppDev web development bootcamp, where I collaborate on projects that help my coding and problem solving skills. I’m passionate about using technology to solve problems and am eager to apply what I learn toward future internships and career opportunities.
Outside of academics, I love going on long walks with friends and trying new food spots. I have also done Bollywood dance since I was four years old! I’m excited to continue growing both technically and personally, while exploring opportunities to contribute to innovative projects and contribute to my community.
